The image above list all 14 registers in x86.


= Details =

Four general registers
  * AX Normally holds some ALU result.
  * BX Can be used as operand or to hold a base address to calculate some offset.
  * CX Normally used for holding counter variables.
  * DX General register for data.

Each register has 16 bytes (1 Word), you can access each byte at time
Ex: High byte and Low byte of AX register

AX

|| AH || AL ||

Four Segment registers: Used to address a data/code/stack segment
  * CS Address for begining of code segment. When used with IP, retrieves the address of next instruction.
  * DS Normally holds some ALU result.
  * SS Normally holds some ALU result.
