The image above list all 14 registers in x86.


= Details =

Four general registers
  * AX Normally holds some ALU result.
  * BX Can be used as operand or to hold a base address to calculate some offset.
  * CX Normally used for holding counter variables.
  * DX General register for data.

Each register has 16 bytes (1 Word), you can access each byte at time
Ex: High byte and Low byte of AX register

AX

|| AH || AL ||

Four Segment registers: Used to address a data/code/stack segment
  * CS Address for begining of code segment. When used with IP, retrieves the address of next instruction.
  * DS Address for begining of data segment. Used with SI for full data address.
  * SS Address for begining of stack segment. Used with SP for next stack position to be addressed.
  * ES Used for some string operations. Used with DI


Five Offset registers: Used to address a data/code/stack segment
  * IP Program Counter , offset for the next instruction to be executed
  * SP and BP Offsets relative to stack (SP top of stack, BP reference for stack)
  * SI and DI Used for data addressing and string manipulation
  * Flags Register wich holds bits signaling ALU operations and control flags
